  I'm a **web engineer** with over 8 years of experience in the tech-tourism industry, specializing in **team leadership** and building web applications from the ground up.

  I have collaborated with international teams, leading projects in both English and Spanish. My two fundamental pillars are **automated testing** and **agile development**, and I strive to facilitate their adoption within the teams I lead.
