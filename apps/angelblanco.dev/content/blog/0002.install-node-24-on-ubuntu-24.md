Getting Node.js 24 running on Ubuntu 24 should be a straightforward process. While Ubuntu comes with a version of Node.js in its default repositories, you might want to use Node.js 24, which will be LTS in October 2025. This guide offers two simple methods to get you set up quickly.

We'll cover a one-liner script that automates everything, including setting up a proper global prefix for npm and enabling [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) via Corepack. For those who prefer manual control, we'll also walk through each step in detail.

### The easy way

I've created a script, so you can install everything by running a single command. This script will set up Node.js 24, configure a global npm prefix (so you don't need `sudo` for global packages), and optionally enable `corepack` (for Yarn and pnpm) and install Bun.

Just open your terminal and run this:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://angelblanco.dev/scripts/ubuntu-install-node-24.sh | bash
```

The script will ask for confirmation at each major step, so you still have control over what gets installed. You can also review the [full script content](#the-script) before running it or customize it for your own needs.

If you dont have `curl` installed:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt instal curl
```

### The step-by-step guide

For those who prefer a hands-on approach, here’s a breakdown of what the script does. You can follow these steps to perform the installation manually.

#### 1. Update dependencies and add the NodeSource repository

First, we need to make sure our system has the necessary tools to fetch and install Node.js.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg
```

Next, we'll add the [NodeSource](https://nodesource.com/) repository, which is a trusted source for up-to-date Node.js versions on Debian and Ubuntu.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_24.x | sudo -E bash -
```

#### 2. Install Node.js and npm

With the repository in place, installing Node.js is as simple as running:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

This command installs both the `node` runtime and the `npm` package manager.

#### 3. Configure npm's global prefix

By default, `npm` installs global packages in a system directory that requires `sudo`. This can lead to permission issues down the line. To avoid this, it's a best practice to configure a local directory for your global packages.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.npm-global
npm config set prefix '~/.npm-global'
```

You'll also need to add this directory to your `PATH`. Open your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file and add the following line:

```bash
export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH
```

#### 4. Enable Corepack (for Yarn and pnpm)

[Corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html) is an experimental tool included with Node.js that simplifies managing different package managers. With it, you don't need to install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) manually.

To enable it, just run:

```bash
sudo corepack enable
```

Now you can use `yarn` and `pnpm` in your projects without any extra installation steps.

#### 5. Install Bun (optional)

[Bun](https://bun.sh/) is a fast, all-in-one JavaScript toolkit that has been gaining a lot of traction. If you want to give it a try, you can install it with its official script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

### The script

This is the complete script that automates the steps above. It includes confirmations and handles temporary files, making the process smooth and safe.

### What about NVM?

[Node Version Manager (NVM)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is a fantastic tool for managing multiple Node.js versions. However, I personally prefer to stick to a single, system-wide installation of the latest LTS version. This approach forces me to keep my projects updated. Besides, Node.js rarely introduces major breaking changes in its LTS releases, so the upgrade process is usually straightforward.

If you prefer the flexibility of NVM, you can still use it, but you would likely choose one method or the other. After installing NVM, you would manage your package managers like `yarn` and `pnpm` by installing them globally via `npm` for each Node version you use. You could then use aliases to switch between different versions of your tools. Be aware that this can sometimes lead to path conflicts or unexpected behavior, so be mindful of which versions are active in your shell.
