If you've ever worked on multiple projects, you know the pain of copying [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) configurations between repositories. Every time you set up a new project, you're either starting from scratch or copy-pasting that `eslint.config.js` file from your last project. There's a better way: create your own shareable ESLint config package. Here's mine!

## Why I love antfu/eslint-config

When I discovered [@antfu/eslint-config](https://github.com/antfu/eslint-config), it was a game-changer. [Anthony Fu](https://antfu.me/) created something that makes ESLint setup incredibly simple. Instead of juggling dozens of plugins, configurations, and peer dependencies, you install one package and you're done.

What makes it special:

- **Zero config by default:** Just import and export. That's it.
- **Opinionated but flexible:** Sensible defaults that work for [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and modern JavaScript projects, but you can override anything.
- **Includes formatters:** No need for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) or other formatting tools. ESLint handles it all.
- **Auto-detects your stack:** It looks at your project and enables the right rules automatically.

For my current stack (Vue + TypeScript), this is hands down the best starting point for ESLint configuration.

## Why create your own ESLint config package?

As much as I love antfu's defaults, I have my own preferences. I like semicolons. I prefer 2-space indentation. I want my Vue components organized in a specific way (template, then script, then style).

But the real power isn't just about personal preferences. It's about **consistency and reusability**. Once you publish your own ESLint config as an [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) package, you can:

- **Use it across all your repositories:** One installation, same rules everywhere.
- **Version control your linting rules:** Update your config package, bump versions in your projects, and everyone gets the latest rules.
- **Share it with your team or the community:** Make it public and others can benefit from your setup.
- **Maintain it in one place:** No more updating the same rules in 10 different projects.

## My ESLint preferences

My config [@angelblanco/eslint-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angelblanco/eslint-config) is built on top of antfu's foundation with a few tweaks:

- **Semicolons enabled:** I like the visual clarity they provide.
- **2-space indentation:** Consistent with my Vue and TypeScript style.
- **Vue block ordering:** Components follow a consistent structure: `<template>` first, then `<script>`, then `<style>`.

These might seem like small details, but when you're working across multiple projects, having consistent styling makes switching contexts much easier.

## How to create your own

Creating your own ESLint config is surprisingly straightforward. I recommend starting from @antfu/eslint-config rather than building from scratch:

1. **Fork @antfu/eslint-config** - Start with [Anthony Fu's repository](https://github.com/antfu/eslint-config) as your foundation
2. **Customize the rules** in `index.ts` to match your preferences
3. **Update package.json** with your own package name and details
4. **Publish to npm** so you can install it in any project
5. **Use it everywhere** by installing and importing it in your projects

For a complete example of how I customized mine, check out the [README in my repository](https://github.com/angelblanco/eslint-config). It includes installation instructions, usage examples, and all the specific rules I modified.

## The bottom line

You don't need to reinvent the wheel to create your own ESLint config. Start with something solid like @antfu/eslint-config, customize it to your liking, and share it as a package. It takes maybe an hour to set up, and then you have a centralized, versioned, reusable linting setup for all your projects.

If you're working with Vue and TypeScript, I'd recommend giving my config a try. If it's not quite right for you, fork it and make it your own. That's the beauty of open source.
