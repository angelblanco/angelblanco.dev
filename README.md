# The source code of [angelblanco.dev](https://angelblanco.dev)

This is my personal webpage and porftolio that you can use as a boilerplate for a fully
functional NUXT JS turborepo deployed to Github Pages with Github Actions and fully open sourced.

## Technologies used

- [Nuxt JS](https://nuxt.com)
- [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Antfu Eslint Config](https://github.com/antfu/eslint-config)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Daisy UI](https://daisyui.com/)
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)

## Nuxt modules

You can find all modules in [apps/angelblanco.dev/nuxt.config.ts](./apps/angelblanco.dev/nuxt.config.ts).

- `@nuxtjs/i18n`: the web page support internazionalization with both spanish and english.
- `@nuxtjs/color-mode`: theme management integrated with daisyui.
- `@nuxtjs/seo`: nuxt seo is configured with all modules with a reasonable detail. For `og:image` I use the chromium render with `playwright` otherwise, it won't work on WSL.
- `@nuxt/icon`: icon set are installed on [apps/angelblanco.dev/package.json](./apps/angelblanco.dev/package.json)
- `@vueuse/nuxt`: used for click outside and other utilities.
- `@nuxt/content` and `@nuxtjs/mdc`: for markdown content management through the app
- `@nuxt/test-utils/module`: for unit and nuxt testing. For e2e testing, [playwright](https://playwright.dev/) is used under [pacakages/playwright](./packages/playwright/)
- `@nuxt/scripts`: for GA support.
- `@pinia/nuxt`
- `@nuxt/image`

## Project structure

- `packages`: shared packages for different tools

## Requirements to run

- **Node JS**: the latest node js LTS version.
- **pnpm**: the version is pinned in package.json.
- **Operating system**: I only build this repo in a ubuntu, both normal and WSL version of it.

## How to install and run this project?

Clone the repo and run:

```bash
pnpm install
```

If you dont have [playwright](https://playwright.dev/) installed yo will ned to install it at least the first time:

```bash
cd apps/angelblanco.dev
pnpm exec playwright install --with-deps
```

In order to start a dev server, run:

```bash
pmpm dev
```

If you have some trouble after updating, it may help to cleanup autogenerated files, you can then run:

```bash
pnpm fresh
```

In order to prerender the page itself, you need to run

```bash
pnpm build
```

If you want to build and preview the resulting webpage you will run:

```bash
pnpm preview
```

If you want to trigger the e2e test, using `pnpm preview` and in other terminal run

```bash
cd packages/playwright
# If you want to regenerate all screenshots
pnpm run test:e2e:fresh

# If you just want to run the test suite
pnpm run test:e2e
```
