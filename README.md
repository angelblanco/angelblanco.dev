# The source code of [angelblanco.dev](https://angelblanco.dev)

This is my personal webpage and portfolio that you can use as a boilerplate for a fully
functional Nuxt turborepo deployed to Github Pages with Github Actions and fully open sourced.

## Technologies used

- [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com)
- [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Antfu Eslint Config](https://github.com/antfu/eslint-config)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Daisy UI](https://daisyui.com/)
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)

## Nuxt modules

You can find all modules in [apps/angelblanco.dev/nuxt.config.ts](./apps/angelblanco.dev/nuxt.config.ts).

- `@nuxtjs/i18n`: The web page supports internationalization in both Spanish and English.
- `@nuxtjs/color-mode`: Theme management integrated with Daisy UI.
- `@nuxtjs/seo`: Nuxt SEO is configured with all modules in reasonable detail. For `og:image`, I use the Chromium renderer with Playwright; otherwise, it won't work on WSL.
- `@nuxt/icon`: Icon sets are installed in [apps/angelblanco.dev/package.json](./apps/angelblanco.dev/package.json).
- `@vueuse/nuxt`: Used for click outside and other utilities.
- `@nuxt/content` and `@nuxtjs/mdc`: For Markdown content management throughout the app.
- `@nuxt/test-utils/module`: For unit and Nuxt testing. For E2E testing, [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) is used under [packages/playwright](./packages/playwright/).
- `@nuxt/scripts`: For GA support.
- `@pinia/nuxt`
- `@nuxt/image`

## Project structure

- `apps`: Deployable applications.
  - `angelblanco.dev`: The source code of the webpage itself, composing the different packages from the Turborepo.
- `packages`: Shared packages for different tools.
  - `conventions`: Guidance for LLM agents.
  - `tsconfig`: Base shared `tsconfig.json` configurations for TypeScript projects.
  - `eslint`: Custom ESLint configuration shared across the monorepo.
  - `fonts`: Defines a CSS for font management with the required fonts as dependencies.
  - `tailwind`: Tailwind 4 CSS file with Daisy UI integration.
  - `playwright`: E2E tests with different browser integrations.

## Requirements to run

- **Node JS**: The latest Node.js LTS version.
- **pnpm**: The version is pinned in package.json.
- **Operating system**: I only build this repo on Ubuntu, both bare-metal and WSL versions.

## How to install and run this project?

Clone the repo and run:

```bash
pnpm install
```

If you don't have [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) installed, you will need to install it at least the first time:

```bash
cd apps/angelblanco.dev
pnpm exec playwright install --with-deps
```

In order to start a dev server, run:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

If you have some trouble after updating, it may help to clean up autogenerated files. You can then run:

```bash
pnpm fresh
```

To prerender the webpage, you need to run:

```bash
pnpm build
```

To build and preview the resulting webpage, run:

```bash
pnpm preview
```

To trigger the E2E tests, run `pnpm preview` and in another terminal, run:

```bash
cd packages/playwright
# If you want to regenerate all screenshots
pnpm run test:e2e:fresh

# If you just want to run the test suite
pnpm run test:e2e
```

The E2E tests will also work if you launch the `pnpm dev` server, however in order to simulate github pages behaviour, `pnpm preview` is preferred.
